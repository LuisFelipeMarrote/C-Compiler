Developed as part of a university project with two colleagues, this repository contains a compiler written in C for a custom programming language. The compiler generates object code in assembly, which is then executed by a virtual machine (interpreter) also implemented in C. This project showcases a deep understanding of compilers, programming languages, and computer architecture.
